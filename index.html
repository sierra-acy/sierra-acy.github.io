					<h2>Media Flashcards</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					A friend and I began taking American Sign Language classes through Visually Speaking and North
					Seattle College in 2020. We wanted flashcards to help us practice on our own, but had a hard time
					finding an existing sloution that did everything we wanted.
					<br>
					I created the Media Flashcards project to solve that problem. Features:
				<ul>
					<li>Practice Mode</li>
					<li>Search Mode</li>
					<li>Option to see sign side, English side, or mixed in Practice Mode</li>
					<li>Sign side can contain static images, gifs, or videos</li>
				</ul>
				The repo is currently private because it contains videos of our instructor demonstrating signs in
				the classes we paid for.

					<h2>Hogwarts Battle</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					My husband and I love to play the Hogwarts Battle deck building board game. However, one of our
					biggest issues with the game is the number of things players need to keep up with at all times,
					often resulting in missed steps and overall incorrect game play.
					<br>
					<br>
					As we're both Software Engineers and were both looking for a project to practice a new programming
					language in, we decided to try building it ourselves. We are developing 2 versions in parallel: mine
					in Python, his in Rust. We pair program in both languages and review each other's code, but put most
					of our energy into developing the game in our respective languages.
					<br>
					<br>
					The repo is currently private due to copyright concerns. Demo coming soon!

					<h2>POUND Setlist Generator</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					I started teaching a fitness format called POUND in 2020. In this format, instructors create a
					setlist
					of tracks. POUND provides setlist templates with different difficulties, lengths, track levels, and
					track types.
					There are so many track options to insert into each slot, that I get overwhelmed when trying to
					create
					or change up a setlist.
					<br>
					<br>
					To solve this, my setlist generator will build a setlsit for me using only songs I know. It is
					currently
					a command-line tool that allows me to choose a setlist difficulty, length, and version and returns
					a full setlist. I can choose to replace a track with a different one and include arm tracks.
					<br>
					<br>
					I have many more ideas in store for this project. In the mean time, you can view my progress on
					<a href="https://github.com/sierra-acy/sierra-acy.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub.</a>

					<h2>TEALS</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/implementation-guide-online/" target="_blank">TEALS, or Tecnology
						Education and Literacy in Schools</a>, is a Microsoft-sponsored program that pairs volunteers
					with
					programming experience with high schools around the country, and Canada. Most schools still do not
					have any kind of CS or technology progrqams, but of the schools that do, they often do not have
					access
					to teachers who are familiar with the material, so teachers end up teaching CS classes with no more
					knowledge than the students.
					<br>
					TEALS provides several benefits:
				<ul>
					<ol>Schools can implement successful CS programs with the help of knowledgable volunteers</ol>
					<ol>Students get direct access to volunteers that are part of the industry that can answer questions
						about the material and careers alike</ol>
					<ol>Over several years with the program, classroom teachers can learn the material alongside
						students
						and take over teaching when they are comfortable with it</ol>
				</ul>

				I volunteered with TEALS from 2017-2020, and have started again in the 2021 school year. I taught
				remotely at Walla Walla High School for the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 school years. Then at Tonasket
				High School for 2019-2020, and starting in 2021 I'm back at Wa-Hi!
				<br>
				I grew up with a family of teachers, so education has alwasy been a very important part of my life. I
				found
				from a young age that I enjoyed teaching: my earliest teaching memory is from when I was about 5 years
				old
				teaching my cousin to read using my Explode the Code phonics books. I never considered teaching as a
				career,
				but once I found TEALS, I realized it was the one thing I had been missing! I get to be a software
				engineer
				AND a teacher! How could it get better than this?

					<h2>Mentorship</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Mentorship is an important part of my professional life. It helps me stay motivated in my job and
					reminds me why I love doing what I do. Even in my much needed year off from TEALS, I pretty quickly
					realized I missed working with students. I joined <a href="https://mentorsintech.com/"
						target="_blank">
						Mentors in Tech, or MinT,</a> where I mentored 2 students on a monthly schedule -- a much more
					manageable time commitment for me that year.

					I have had several great mentors in my career so far, starting with my step-dad (or bonus-dad, as we
					liked to say) Abel Wang, who introduced me to CS. I was lucky to have someone around to help me with
					homework, answer my questions, and engage and encourage me in CS, so I am always happy to be that
					person for someone
					else.

					<h2>POUND Fit</h2>

				<p>I started taking POUND classes in 2018. I always hated exercising, but I really
					enjoyed POUND. In
					November 2020, I officially became a POUND Pro! See the details below for more information on POUND
					and how to join my classes!</p>

					POUND is for everybody and every body, designed for all fitness levels! Channel your inner rockstar
					with this full body cardio-jam session inspired by the infectious,
					energizing, and sweat-dripping fun of playing the drums!

					Visit the <a href="https://poundfit.com/">POUND Fit website</a> or the <a
						href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PoundRockoutWorkout"> YouTube channel</a> for more info and a
					sneak peak at what a POUND class looks like.

				<h3 id="how_join">How do I join?</h3>
				<p><b>NOTE: APRIL 16 CLASS MOVED TO FRIDAY APRIL 15 AT 4PM PACIFIC.</b></p>
				<p><b>NOTE: APRIL 23 CLASS MOVED TO SUNDAY APRIL 24 AT 10AM PACIFIC.</b></p>
				<p>
					Classes are every Saturday at 10am pacific.
					<a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/j/83650772455?pwd=QkRHbXI1dnc4am9tZDFkT3d3Tm9Ldz09">Click here
						to join our Zoom class!</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					Classes are donation-based and 100% of the proceeds (x3) will be donated to a charity. Check out the
					<a href="#how_donations_work">How do donations work?</a> section for more details.
					This month, we're donating to Empact Northwest. <a
						href="https://gofund.me/7e3c25b5">Click
						here</a> to read about the charity and donate! The recommended donation is $5, but any amount
					counts.
				</p>
				<h3>What do I need?</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A yoga mat to stand on. If you will be Pounding on a surface you don't want damaged (ex:
						hardwood floors),
						2 yoga mats recommended.)</li>
					<li>In POUND, we use Ripstix (those green drumsticks), that are weighted 1/4
						pound each, but if you don't have any, you can use your hands and clap!</li>
					<li>Water!!!</li>
					<li>Shoes are optional</li>
					<li>A device to see and hear me with!</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="how_donations_work">How do dontions work?</h3>
				<p>
					This class is donation based. The recommended donation is $5, but any amount counts. In fact, every
					donation will be multiplied by 3!<br>
					<br>
					How? Each month, we’ll donate class proceeds to a different charity. Then, I will match the total
					class donations for a month. Finally, my company will match my personal donation.<br>
					<br>
					For example, if 5 people attend class every week for a month, paying $5 each class, the total class
					donations for the month are $100. I will match the $100 with my own personal donation. Then, my
					company will match my personal donation with another $100. That’s a total of $300 to a single
					charity in one month!<br>
					<br>
					Have a charity you would like to see represented? I’m open to recommendations!<br>
					<br>
					Find the link to the current donation campaign in the <a href="#how_join">How do I join?</a>
					section.
