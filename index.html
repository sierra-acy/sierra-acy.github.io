					<b>NOTE:</b> This listing is for Java rather than JavaScript. Despite the similar name, the two 
						languages are very different. If you need JavaScript tutoring and are having a hard time

						not a language I have taught before and is not my expertise, but I may be able to help.
					<br>
					<br>
					<p>One-on-one tutoring is open to all ages. This option is great for students

						learning Java one-on-one with a teacher or outside of a formal classroom.</p>
					<p>I recommend Java for high school students who are planning to take the AP 
						Computer Science A test, students looking to learn about Object-Oriented Programming, or 
						students looking to get into Minecraft modding or Android App Development. For other 
						students, I'd recommend learning Python, which I offer through <a href="#python-small-group">
						small group classes</a> or <a href="#python-tutoring">one-on-one tutoring.</a></p>
					<p>During a tutoring session, we will cover certain topics or materials requested by the student. 
						Students and parents will lead in defining the goals for the session. The requested topic or 
						material should be provided 24 hours ahead of time, when possible, to allow me to plan an 
						appropriate lecture or activity and come prepared to help! When not available ahead of time, 
						I will do my best to gather context quickly and jump into tutoring as best I can with the

					<h2>TEALS</h2>
				</header>
				<p>I have volunteered with the TEALS program (Tecnology Education and Literacy in Schools) teaching 
					AP Computer Science A since 2017, with a small break for the 2020-2021 school year. I taught one 
					year at Tonasket High School (remotely), one year at Renton High School (in person), and the rest 
					at Walla Walla High School (remotely).
				</p>
				<p>I grew up in a family of teachers, so education has always been a very important part of my life. 
					I found from a young age that I enjoyed teaching: my earliest teaching memory is from when I was 
					about 5 years old teaching my cousin to read using my Explode the Code phonics books. Growing up, 
					I hadn't considered teaching as a career, but once I found TEALS, I realized it was the one thing 
					I had been missing! I made the switch from Software Engineer to Tutor in 2023, which has allowed 
					me to focus on the things that I love most: teaching and coding!
				</p>
				<p><a href="https://www.tealsk12.org/implementation-guide-online/" target="_blank">TEALS, or 
					Tecnology Education and Literacy in Schools</a>, is a Microsoft-sponsored program that pairs 
					volunteers who have programming experience with high schools around the U.S. and Canada. Most 
					schools still do not have any kind of Computer Science or technology programs, and of the schools 
					that do, they often do not have access to teachers who are familiar with the material, so 
					teachers end up teaching CS classes with no more knowledge than the students.
				</p>
				<p class="custom-p">TEALS provides several benefits:</p>
				<ul style="margin-top:0;">
					<li>Schools can implement successful CS programs with the help of knowledgeable volunteers</li>
					<li>Students get direct access to volunteers that are part of the industry that can answer 
						questions about both the material and careers</li>
					<li>Over several years with the program, classroom teachers can learn the material alongside
						students and take over teaching when they are comfortable with it</li>

					</a>
					<h2>Mentorship</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					Mentorship is an important part of my professional life. It helps me stay motivated in my job and
					reminds me why I love doing what I do. Even in my much needed year off from TEALS, I pretty quickly
					realized I missed working with students. I joined <a href="https://mentorsintech.com/"
						target="_blank">
						Mentors in Tech, or MinT,</a> where I mentored 2 students on a monthly schedule -- a much more
					manageable time commitment for me that year.

					I have had several great mentors in my career so far, starting with my step-dad (or bonus-dad, as we
					liked to say) Abel Wang, who introduced me to CS. I was lucky to have someone around to help me with
					homework, answer my questions, and engage and encourage me in CS, so I am always happy to be that
					person for someone
					else.
